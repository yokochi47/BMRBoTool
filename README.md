# BMRBoTool

The BMRBoTool converts NMR-STAR data ([**BMRB/XML**](https://bmrbpub.pdbj.org/archive/xml-noatom)) into RDF format ([**BMRB/RDF**](https://bmrbpub.pdbj.org/archive/rdf)). Along with the BMRB/RDF, BMRBoTool generates its ontology in the OWL format ([**BMRB/OWL**](https://bmrbpub.pdbj.org/schema/mmcif_nmr-star.owl)). The both RDF and OWL constitutes a standard model for data interchange on the Web and makes it possible to query across diverse data sources using RDF query language, SPARQL.<br />
BMRBoTool is designed to work in combination with [BMRBxTool](https://github.com/yokochi47/BMRBxTool) which generates validated BMRB/XML files.<br />
The [**PDBj-BMRB Data Server**](https://bmrbpub.pdbj.org) has opened for publishing these alternative representations of NMR-STAR data.
